  //Your Personality
  var monit; // Stop copying others and get a personality  
  var flalt; // Stop pretending to be an altruist. We both know you don't care about these people  
  var pet; // You lick the boots of anyone in authority 
  var bomb; // Everyone walks on eggshells around you. Don't believe them when they say they don't. You're a ticking time bomb. 
  var fake; // You lie to others, lie to yourself, and even your heart lies to you. You will try to chase, but love will always be one step away of you.

  //Your Narrative 
  var intr; // You aren't an introvert. You just say that when you don't like the person you're talking to. 
  var extr; // You are the life of the party but no one invited you. Your presence is unneccessary 
  var irr; // You can't cope with how irrelevant you are. You will never be good enough. Stop lying to yourself
  var cold; // You secretly enjoy the pain of others. Stop pretending to be sad and just laugh in their face already.
  var perf; //You pretend to have it all together, but secretly want someone to save you. Grow up. 

  //Your Thoughts and actions
  var hero; //You love to be the hero, but you would rather pretend to be the victim than accept when you're the villian. 
  var lube; //I know your kinks are rare, but there's nothing to be ashamed of...
  var brkmtl; //You will never escape the broke mentality 
  var pess; //You will never achieve what you want in life because you already know that to be true
  var sad; // Happiness is chasing you, but you are fast

  // What you fail to admit 
  var glass; // Unfortunately you are so transparent, others can see more of you than you can see of yourself
  var codep; // You don't enable other people's bad behavior because you're kind. You want to see them destroy themselves so you can save them. 
  var holy; //There is no reason to pretend you are a person af virture
  var dis; // Everyone already knows you are an imposter. They are just waiting for you to admit you're incompetent, but we both know that you never will
  var brkn; // You are a disappointment to anyone who tries to love you. Dist yourself off. You're the only one who can.
